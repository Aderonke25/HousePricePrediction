# House Price Prediction

A linear regression model designed to predict house prices based on various property features.

---

## Overview

This project focuses on using a comprehensive dataset of house prices to train and evaluate a linear regression model. The objective is to explore the relationships between property characteristics and house prices and to evaluate the model's performance using statistical metrics.

## Challenge Description

The challenge involves solving tasks related to house price prediction using a given dataset. Students are required to:

1. Solve the challenges independently.
2. Submit solutions via MyLearning and MS Teams.
3. Present their solutions in class during the final two weeks.

### Important Notes:

- Weekly challenges must be solved individually, and no solutions will be provided by instructors.
- Completing challenges builds your task portfolio, which is essential for module grading. Refer to the module specifications (CST4050 intro) or consult your instructor for grading details.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following features:

- **Rooms**: Average number of rooms per dwelling.
- **Age**: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
- **Distance**: Weighted distances to employment centers.
- **Accessibility**: Index of accessibility to highways.
- **Tax**: Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.
- **DisadvantagedPosition**: Percentage of the population with lower status.
- **Crime**: Per capita crime rate.
- **NitricOxides**: Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
- **PupilTeacher**: Pupil-teacher ratio by town.
- **Residential**: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft.
- **NonRetail**: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
- **Price**: House prices in thousands of dollars (USD) (target variable).

## Tasks

1. **Train the Model**:
   - Develop a linear regression model to predict house prices (dependent variable) based on the provided independent variables.

2. **Evaluate the Model**:
   - Assess the model's performance using:
     - **R-squared**: Proportion of variance explained by the model.
     - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

3. **Interpretation**:
   - Analyze the regression model, focusing on:
     - The significance of the Î² coefficients associated with standardized independent variables.
     - Identifying the variable with the most substantial influence on house price predictions.

4. **Multicollinearity Analysis**:
   - Discuss the presence of multicollinearity in the dataset and its potential effects on the regression model.
